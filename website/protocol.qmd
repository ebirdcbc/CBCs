## Title: "eBirdCBC Protocol"

# Overview

eBirdCBC uses eBird and eBird tracks to record all bird and participant data, automating the summary of territory counts for the Christmas Bird Count (CBC). This is combined with manual data collection throughout the day, including effort details and sightings of raptors and large birds.

# Preparing for an eBird-Powered Count Area

1\. Work together to divide the count subareas into non-overlapping routes.

2\. Map these routes and define clear boundaries forming distinct polygons.

3\. Color-code the polygons to reduce confusion.

4\. Build team assignments based on these color-coded polygons.

# In-Field Methods

\- Each team covers their assigned route/polygon starting early in the day.

\- Create a separate eBird list for each unique count area (polygon) crossed.

\- Start a new eBird list with eBird tracks enabled to capture your bird observations for each polygon.

\- Also, this will form the basis of your CBC effort data (see Effort and manual transcription below)

\- For large polygons, create multiple lists.

\- Track total party miles and total party hours.

\- Transcribe eBird data and manual effort notes into eBird list comments.

\- When crossing into other teams’ polygons, create separate lists to collect replicate eBird data. These data will be compared and we will use the \\\*high counts\\\* (e.g. =MAX) for overlapping stationary birds.

\- Do not include birds seen by people outside your CBC party.

\- Start new lists frequently for outlined subareas within your polygon.

\- Record birds seen between polygons in the species comments with relevant details.

# Effort and Manual Transcription

\- Assign a team member to log effort, raptors, and rare bird notes on paper for transcription into the eBird memo.

\- Include the following in effort notes:

-   Team names, participants, list numbers, start/stop times and locations, weather, and raptor/rare bird sightings.

\- Track total party miles (one-way distance) and total party hours (nearest minute).

\- Document raptors and rare birds according to the provided guidelines.

\- Ensure your effort notes match each separate list (e.g. separate area/polygon).

# Raptors and Large Flying Birds

Raptors and large flying birds are crucial to track for accurate counts and movement patterns:

\- Record species, age, sex, plumage, time, location, flight direction, behavior, and other details.

\- Use a paper tally sheet to ensure data consistency.

\- Add this information to species comments in eBird after the count.

\- These data help prevent double-counting across subareas and are required for compilation.

## Example Table for Raptors and Large Birds

\| Species \| Location \| Time \| Flight Direction \| Age \| Sex \| Plumage \| Notes \|

\| ---------------- \| ------------------ \| ---- \| ---------------- \| ----- \| ---- \| ------- \| --------------------------------- \|

\| Golden Eagle \| M-ranch entry road \| 0915 \| NE \| Adult \| NA \| NA \| Flying high and fast. \|

\| Northern Harrier \| M-ranch entry road \| 0920 \| N \| Adult \| Male \| NA \| Flying low into Yellow territory. \|

# Reminders

\- Do not include birds seen by people outside your CBC party.

\- Accurate data ensures reliability and utility for future counts.

# Why Use eBird for Christmas Bird Counts?

Integrating eBird into CBCs simplifies data compilation, captures local knowledge, and improves accuracy. By combining eBird lists and the MAX-SUM™ algorithm, we:

\- Eliminate double-counting and confusion.

\- Enhance repeatability and data reliability.

\- Preserve cultural and local knowledge about count areas and team deployment.

This hybrid approach ensures the long-term success of the CBC as the world’s longest-running community science project while adapting to the information age.
