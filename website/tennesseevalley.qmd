### Notes for Data Collection

-   Use unique eBird checklists for each trail, area, or significant habitat change (see the assigned maps below for each team).

-   Record effort details such as miles, hours, and environmental conditions to align with eBird data.

-   High counts (MAX) are used for overlapping stationary birds, while moving birds are flagged in comments for behavior and movement patterns.
