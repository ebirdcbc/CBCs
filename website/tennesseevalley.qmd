# Tennessee Valley: Multiple lists define separate routes

The Tennessee Valley subarea is part of the Southern Marin Christmas Bird Count circle (CBC). This area features diverse habitats, from oak woodlands to coastal scrub, grasslands, riparian creeks, marshes, ponds, beach and nearshore waters making it an ideal location for bird observation. Since access to the various regions in the subarea are varied and several overlap on the main valley trail (both in and out and parts intersected by separate teams) we've divided the area into many small eBird checklists. Below are specific assignments and considerations for teams covering this area.

### Overview

### Owling

-   **Pre-dawn Owling:** Teams begin at **Owling Oakwood #0** (usually early around \<=0530-0555) and **Tennessee Valley #1** (\~0600-0700) Owling can be productive here during early morning hours.

### Team Assignments and Key Areas

1.  **Marincello to Alta Trail Returning Via Oakwood and Rhubarb (Loop)**:

    -   Route: From Oakwood Valley **#9** to Alta Trail (pink, not numbered) to Marincello Trail **#2**, and return via Rhubarb Trail **#15**.

2.  **Miwok Livery Stables and Old Springs Trail**:

    -   Route: Miwok Livery **#3** to Oldsprings Trail **#4,** to Miwok trail **#6,** Coastal Trail **#7** to Hill 88 **#8**, dropping into Tennessee Valley in the lower area **#12**.

3.  **Tennessee Valley**:

    -   Teams split into two:

        -   **Haypress Team:** Covers trails through the north half of the valley (**#1**, **#5**, **#10**, **#11**-nursery, **#12**).

        -   **Lower Team:** Moves super early to focuses on trails through the south half of the valley (**#16**, **#17**, **#13**, and a seawatch from the Tennessee Valley Overlook **#18**).

4.  **Ponds and Tennessee Beach**:

    -   Both teams document observations at Lower Tennessee Valley (including the Pond) **#17** (separate lists until teams reunite).

    -   Tennessee Beach is surveyed from the shore, with the early team climbing to the Tennessee Valley Overlook **#18 for** a seawatch from above the beach.

### Notes for Data Collection

-   Use unique eBird checklists for each trail, area, or significant habitat change (see the assigned maps below for each team).

-   Record effort details such as miles, hours, and environmental conditions to align with eBird data.

-   High counts (MAX) are used for overlapping stationary birds, while moving birds are flagged in comments for behavior and movement patterns.

-   Remember: Independent counts from different areas are **SUM**med!
