## About eBirdCBC

eBirdCBC is a project designed to modernize and streamline the process of compiling data for Christmas Bird Counts (CBCs). Leveraging eBird’s data collection and tracking capabilities, eBirdCBC integrates these tools with an innovative algorithm to simplify workflows, eliminate double-counting, and enhance the reproducibility of CBCs.

### Goals

-   **Encourage Participation**: Increase engagement by providing easier and more accessible data collection tools for bird counters.
-   **Improve Accuracy**: Address challenges such as overlapping count areas and inconsistent methods with a robust data integration system.
-   **Preserve Knowledge**: Ensure long-term reproducibility and documentation of count methods and results.

### Methods

#### Preparation

1.  Create an **eBird persona** for the CBC area to collect and centralize data.
2.  Assign participants to use either eBird or paper-based methods, allowing flexibility.
3.  Create and share a trip report linked to the CBC, ensuring all participants' checklists are included.

#### Data Integration

1.  Copy the trip report URL and paste it into the eBirdCBC tool.
2.  Log in using the shared eBird persona credentials.
3.  The tool automatically gathers tracks and species data from all associated eBird checklists.

#### Compilation

1.  Use **Species Mode** in the eBirdCBC tool to review counts species-by-species.
2.  Identify overlapping counts visually using tracks and assign group numbers.
3.  Apply the **MAX-SUM™ algorithm**:
    -   Take the maximum count for overlapping stationary birds.
    -   Sum non-overlapping counts.
4.  Exclude erroneous or unwanted data using the "Delete Group" feature.

#### Export

1.  Generate a comprehensive CSV report with species counts and grouped checklists.
2.  Share the database with compilers and upload it back into the app for review.

### Key Benefits

-   **Efficiency**: Simplifies data compilation for CBC organizers.
-   **Engagement**: Attracts younger participants by integrating with familiar digital tools.
-   **Reproducibility**: Creates a clear audit trail for count data, enhancing scientific value.

### Real-World Applications

#### Tennessee Valley

This area demonstrates how retrospective mapping and eBird integration improve count accuracy and participant coordination.

#### Abbotts Lagoon

With a large diversity of species, Abbotts Lagoon exemplifies the value of clear data management and the MAX-SUM™ algorithm in minimizing double-counting.

### Why eBirdCBC Matters

CBCs are one of the longest-running community science projects, offering valuable insights into bird populations over time. By modernizing this tradition with eBirdCBC, we can: - Foster greater interest and participation. - Ensure data accuracy and integrity. - Provide tools for better understanding environmental changes.

This project bridges the gap between tradition and innovation, making CBCs more accessible and impactful for generations to come.
