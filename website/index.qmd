## eBirdCBC Project

Welcome to the eBirdCBC project, a hybrid approach to modernizing the Christmas Bird Count (CBC) using eBird data and tools. Explore how we blend traditional methods with digital tools to enhance accuracy, repeatability, increase CBC participation, and the long-term value for bird conservation efforts.

### Why Use eBird for Christmas Bird Counts?

Integrating eBird into CBCs simplifies data compilation, captures local knowledge, and improves accuracy. By combining eBird lists and the MAX-SUM™ algorithm, we:

-   Eliminate double-counting and confusion.

-   Enhance repeatability and data reliability.

-   Preserve cultural and local knowledge about count areas and team deployment.

This hybrid approach ensures the long-term success of the CBC as the world’s longest-running community science project while adapting to the information age.
