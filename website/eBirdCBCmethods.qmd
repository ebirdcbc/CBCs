# Using the eBirdCBC method

eBirdCBC is a set of field methods (using [eBird](https://ebird.org/home)) and a web-based program ([eBirdCBC](https://github.com/ddkapan/eBirdCBC/blob/main/README.md)) designed to modernize and streamline the process of compiling data for [Christmas Bird Counts](https://www.audubon.org/community-science/christmas-bird-count) (CBCs). Leveraging [eBird ](https://ebird.org/news/ebird-ios-automatic-tracks-available/)[mobile's](https://ebird.org/about/ebird-mobile/) data collection and [tracking](https://ebird.org/news/ebird-ios-automatic-tracks-available/) capabilities, eBirdCBC integrates these tools with an innovative algorithm to simplify workflows, eliminate double-counting, and enhance the reproducibility of CBCs.

### Methods for area leaders

Below are the methods for area leaders. All participants should read these over to understand what your area leader going to do with the data you collect using the participant team's [field protocol](fieldprotocol.html).

#### Pre-count preparation

1.  Create an **eBird persona** for the CBC area to collect and centralize data. This is a new eBird login from a new eBird email. For instance create a login e.g. "myebirdarea" with a new email address e.g. "myebirdarea\@gmail.com."
2.  Assign area participants in small groups non-overlapping routes (see Field protocol) to use either eBird or paper-based methods that get transcribed to eBird after the count, allowing flexibility.
3.  Each team of one or more people birding independently use eBird to track their observations (see [field protocol](fieldprotocol.html)).
4.  Work with the team to review and correct each list's data and ensure the final list is shared back to the the central eBird persona.
5.  Combine all the lists and create and share a trip report linked to the CBC, ensuring all participants' checklists are included.
6.  Pro-tip, use your new email to organize all the communication with your participants!
7.  Caution: only use your eBird persona on the day of the count! It is for aggregating all of your data from each group/participant's separate eBird list.

#### Data Integration

1.  Copy the trip report URL and paste it into the eBirdCBC tool.
2.  Log into eBird using the shared eBird persona credentials.
3.  The tool automatically gathers tracks and species data from all associated eBird checklists.

#### Compilation

1.  Use **Species Mode** in the eBirdCBC tool to review counts species-by-species.
2.  Identify overlapping counts visually using tracks and assign group numbers.
3.  Apply the **MAX-SUM™ algorithm**:
    -   Take the maximum count for overlapping stationary birds.
    -   Sum non-overlapping counts.
4.  Exclude erroneous or unwanted data using the "Delete Group" feature.
5.  Save (frequently) the final results.

#### Export

1.  Generate a comprehensive CSV report with species counts and grouped checklists.
2.  We generally use a spreadsheet to link eBirdCBC csv output to the compilers spreadsheet input.
3.  Then we share that data with compilers.
4.  We an upload the data back into the app for review.

### Key Benefits

-   **Efficiency**: Simplifies data compilation for CBC organizers.
-   **Engagement**: Attracts younger participants by integrating with familiar digital tools.
-   **Reproducibility**: Creates a clear audit trail for count data, enhancing scientific value.

### Why eBirdCBC Matters

CBCs are one of the longest-running community science projects, offering valuable insights into bird populations over time. By modernizing this tradition with eBirdCBC, we can: - Foster greater interest and participation. - Ensure data accuracy and integrity. - Provide tools for better understanding environmental changes.

This project bridges the gap between tradition and innovation, making CBCs more accessible and impactful for generations to come.
