# Using the eBirdCBC method

eBirdCBC is a browser-based program and a set of field methods to modernize and streamline the process of compiling [eBird](https://ebird.org/home) data for [Christmas Bird Counts](https://www.audubon.org/community-science/christmas-bird-count) (CBCs). Leveraging [eBird](https://ebird.org/news/ebird-ios-automatic-tracks-available/)[-mobile's](https://ebird.org/about/ebird-mobile/) data collection and [tracking](https://ebird.org/news/ebird-ios-automatic-tracks-available/) capabilities, eBirdCBC integrates these tools with an innovative **MAX-SUM algorithm** to simplify workflows, eliminate double-counting, and enhance the reproducibility of CBCs. This page instructs **area leaders** on the details, but is useful for counters as well as CBC compilers to understand how to use the eBirdCBC method [Before the count], [in the field](fieldprotocol.html), and [after the count](usingtheprogram.html).

### **MAX-SUM algorithm**

The MAX-SUM algorithm ensures accurate bird counts during Christmas Bird Counts (CBCs), especially when multiple teams traverse the same areas and might see the same birds. Here’s how it works:

1.  **Birds Stay Still in Overlapping Areas**: When stationary birds (like sparrows or herons) are reported by multiple teams in the same area, we take the highest count (MAX) from any team. This avoids double-counting while providing the best estimate.

2.  **Birds Move Between Areas**: For mobile species (like swans or hawks) observed by different teams, we apply MAX if it’s clear the same birds are being reported (based on observation details in the field protocol).

3.  **Stationary Birds in Separate Areas**: For birds that remain stationary in different areas, we sum (SUM) the counts from each team’s list. This is common for small, non-mobile species, with exceptions like high flyover flocks.

In short: The eBirdCBC program **takes the MAX for overlapping counts** and **SUM the counts for non-overlapping areas**. This keeps the bird count as accurate as possible without overestimating or underestimating the numbers.

### **Area leader instructions:**

Below are methods for area leaders, covering preparation, team assignment planning, instructions for team members, and post-count tasks. Participants can also benefit from understanding how eBird data collected using the field protocol will be utilized.

#### Before the count

-   Area leaders should create a [new eBird account](https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48001158707-get-started-with-ebird#Create-a-free-account) (persona) for the CBC area, using a unique login (e.g., “myebirdarea”) and email (e.g., “myebirdarea\@gmail.com”). This account aggregates all eBird data for the count by ‘riding along’ with each group.
-   Assign area participants in small groups non-overlapping routes (see [Field protocol](fieldprotocol.html)) to use either eBird or paper-based methods that get transcribed to eBird after the count, allowing flexibility.
-   Each team of one or more people birding independently use eBird to track their observations (see below and [Field protocol](fieldprotocol.html)).

##### Planning your area's team assignments

-   Divide the count subareas into non-overlapping routes. These may correspond roughly to the concept of the 'birdshed' and form an area where you can likely keep track of raptors and large-birds. If you assign a large area to a team, this might be a set of connected 'birdsheds' that you'll divide into smaller areas for lists by each habitat.

-   Map these routes and define clear boundaries for forming 'birdsheds' distinct polygons.

-   Color-code the routes or polygons to reduce confusion.

-   Indicate on the map where to start and stop each eBird list (see [Field protoco](fieldprotocol.html)l for more information).

-   If you have existing eBird track data, use eBirdCBC to plot out the individual list areas.

-   Build team assignments based on these color-coded polygons.

#### In the field (see the [Field protocol](fieldprotocol.html))

To employ the eBirdCBC technique, we must follow our [field protocol](fieldprotocol.html), otherwise we cannot use the MAX-SUM approach.

#### After the count

-   Work with the team to review and correct each list's data and ***ensure the final list is shared back to the the central eBird persona***.
-   This process can be a bit cumbersome: team leaders share the list to your eBird persona, you make corrections and share it back to the team leader who accept the list. If they make further corrections or add photographs, you need to have them *reshare* the list to your eBird persona to have the final data for compilation.
-   ***Combine all the lists*** and create and share a [trip report](https://ebird.org/news/introducing-ebird-trip-reports) linked to the CBC, ensuring all participants' checklists are included.
-   Pro-tip, use your new eBird persona email to organize all the communication with your participants!
-   Caution: Use your eBird persona only on the day of the count or during count week. It is specifically for the CBC to aggregate all data from each group or participant’s separate eBird lists.

### Using the eBird CBC program: quick start

#### Data Integration

-   For installation and detailed instructions see: [Using the eBirdCBC program](usingtheprogram.html)
-   Open eBirdCBC
-   Copy the trip report URL and paste it into the eBirdCBC tool.
-   Log into eBird using the shared eBird persona credentials.
-   The tool automatically gathers tracks and species data from all associated eBird checklists.

#### Compilation

-   Use **Species Mode** in the eBirdCBC tool to review counts species-by-species.
-   Identify overlapping counts visually using tracks and assign group numbers.
-   Apply the **MAX-SUM algorithm**:
    -   Take the maximum count for overlapping stationary birds.
    -   Sum non-overlapping counts.
-   Exclude erroneous or unwanted data using the "Delete Group" feature.
-   Save (frequently) the final results.

#### Export

-   Generate a comprehensive CSV report with species counts and grouped checklists.
-   We generally use a spreadsheet to link eBirdCBC csv output to the compilers spreadsheet input.
-   Then we share that data with compilers.
-   We an upload the data back into the app for review.
