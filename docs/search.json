    "text": "Tennessee Valley: Multiple lists define separate routes\nThe Tennessee Valley subarea is part of the Southern Marin Christmas Bird Count circle (CBC). This area features diverse habitats, from oak woodlands to coastal scrub, grasslands, riparian creeks, marshes, ponds, beach and nearshore waters making it an ideal location for bird observation. Since access to the various regions in the subarea are varied and several overlap on the main valley trail (both in and out and parts intersected by separate teams) we’ve divided the area into many small eBird checklists. Below are specific assignments and considerations for teams covering this area.\n\nOverview\n\n\n\nOverview of the Tennessee Valley area for the S. Marin Christmas Bird Count.

    "text": "Protocol for eBirding a CBC!\neBirdCBC uses eBird and eBird tracks to record all bird and participant data, automating the summary of territory counts for the Christmas Bird Count (CBC). This is combined with eBird mobile and manual data collection throughout the day, including capturing effort details and sightings of raptors and large birds.\n\nCount area leaders: how to prepare for an eBird-Powered Count Area before going to the field\n\nDivide the count subareas into non-overlapping routes.\nMap these routes and define clear boundaries forming distinct polygons.\nColor-code the polygons to reduce confusion.\nBuild team assignments based on these color-coded polygons.\n\n\n\nCBC area participants: field details: eBird lists, tracks\nFor a given team, designate a team member to use eBird mobile to track team location and log birds using one of the following methods:\n\nActivate eBird starting a new list enabling eBird tracks.\n\nTally birds at the same time on the app.\n\n-or put your phone in your pocket and-\n\nWrite the date, time, location & each bird encountered on paper and transfer to eBird mobile ASAP. See this convenient PDF form for the latter.\n\nEither way, eBird Mobile tracks allow us to divide observations by route for us to automatically compile in eBird.\n\n\n\nKeeping track of the details by hand\nDesignate a second member as a ‘back-up’ to log participants, effort, raptors & large flyover birds, and rare bird notes on paper to later transcribe the following into the eBird memo:\n\nTeam name and list number (i.e. Haypress #1).\nThe name (initials) of each participant. \nExact start and stop times & locations for each list (sometimes eBird tracks fail).\nNote the weather: cloud cover, temperature, wind (Beaufort scale) & precipitation (none, trace, light, medium, heavy).\n\n\n\n\nExample of effort memo for a given list. Note everything needed to figure out the who, the where, the when, the weather, the raptors and large birds as well as the route.\n\n\n\n\nRaptors and Large Flying Birds\nWith raptors and other large mobile birds it is crucial to track for accurate counts and movement patterns:\n\nRecord species, time, location, flight direction, age, sex, plumage, behavior, and other details.\nUse a paper tally sheet to ensure data consistency.\nAdd this information to species comments in eBird after the count.\nThese data help prevent double-counting across subareas and are required for compilation.\n\n\n\nExample Table for Raptors and Large Birds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nLocation\nTime\nFlight direction\nAge\nSex\nPlumage\nNotes\n\n\nGolden Eagle\nM-ranch entry road\n0915\nNE\nAdult\nNA\nNA\nThis bird was flying high and fast.\n\n\nNorthern Harrier\nM-ranch entry road\n0920\nN\nAdult\nMale\nNA\nHarrying low flying into the Yellow territory\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is really important to:\n\nSwitch eBird lists and by-hand effort notes at the same time throughout the day for each different assigned route/list area.\nCreate a new list even when you are returning across your or another team’s route/polygon.\nStart a new eBird list with new metadata for any changes in team membership. \neBird lists will help us keep track of total party miles (one-way distance) and total party hours (nearest minute).\nDocument Rare Birds and put this documentation on paper and into your eBird lists: tips for documenting unusual observations.\nPhotographs: Photos and/or audio recordings of diagnostic vocalizations are the best evidence of a rare bird. Photos are preferably of good quality showing diagnostic features.\nUpload and Share: Last but not least–after your eBird lists are all set and uploaded to eBird, share them with your area leader’s persona using the share function either from eBird mobile, or from the your eBird list on the web interface. If they ask you to correct something, do so and RESHARE back to their eBird persona.\n\n\n\nReminders\n\nEach team covers their assigned route/polygon starting at sunrise early in the day.\nCreate a new eBird list for each unique count area (polygon) with eBird tracks enabled. This forms the basis for both bird observations and CBC effort data (see below for hints on manual data collection).\nFor large polygons, create multiple lists, especially when moving from one habitat to another or when you have passed out of an area (a ‘birdshed’) where you cannot track the larger birds you just counted any more.\nTranscribe eBird data and manual effort notes into eBird list comments. Put raptor details into the species comments.\nWhen crossing into other teams’ polygons, create separate eBird lists to collect replicate eBird data. These data will be compared and we will use the high counts (e.g. =MAX) for overlapping stationary birds.\nRecord birds seen between polygons in the species comments with relevant details.\nDo not include birds seen by people outside your CBC party.\n\n© 2015-2024 Durrell D.

    "text": "Using the eBirdCBC method\neBirdCBC is a set of field methods (using eBird) and a web-based program (eBirdCBC) designed to modernize and streamline the process of compiling data for Christmas Bird Counts (CBCs). Leveraging eBirdmobile’s data collection and tracking capabilities, eBirdCBC integrates these tools with an innovative algorithm to simplify workflows, eliminate double-counting, and enhance the reproducibility of CBCs.\n\nMethods for area leaders\nBelow are the methods for area leaders. All participants should read these over to understand what your area leader going to do with the data you collect using the participant team’s field protocol.\n\nPre-count preparation\n\nCreate an eBird persona for the CBC area to collect and centralize data. This is a new eBird login from a new eBird email. For instance create a login e.g. “myebirdarea” with a new email address e.g. “myebirdarea@gmail.com.”\nAssign area participants in small groups non-overlapping routes (see Field protocol) to use either eBird or paper-based methods that get transcribed to eBird after the count, allowing flexibility.\nEach team of one or more people birding independently use eBird to track their observations (see field protocol).\nWork with the team to review and correct each list’s data and ensure the final list is shared back to the the central eBird persona.\nCombine all the lists and create and share a trip report linked to the CBC, ensuring all participants’ checklists are included.\nPro-tip, use your new email to organize all the communication with your participants!\nCaution: only use your eBird persona on the day of the count! It is for aggregating all of your data from each group/participant’s separate eBird list.\n\n\n\nData Integration\n\nCopy the trip report URL and paste it into the eBirdCBC tool.\nLog into eBird using the shared eBird persona credentials.\nThe tool automatically gathers tracks and species data from all associated eBird checklists.\n\n\n\nCompilation\n\nUse Species Mode in the eBirdCBC tool to review counts species-by-species.\nIdentify overlapping counts visually using tracks and assign group numbers.\nApply the MAX-SUM™ algorithm:\n\nTake the maximum count for overlapping stationary birds.\nSum non-overlapping counts.\n\nExclude erroneous or unwanted data using the “Delete Group” feature.\nSave (frequently) the final results.\n\n\n\nExport\n\nGenerate a comprehensive CSV report with species counts and grouped checklists.\nWe generally use a spreadsheet to link eBirdCBC csv output to the compilers spreadsheet input.\nThen we share that data with compilers.\nWe an upload the data back into the app for review.\n\n\n\n\nKey Benefits\n\nEfficiency: Simplifies data compilation for CBC organizers.\nEngagement: Attracts younger participants by integrating with familiar digital tools.\nReproducibility: Creates a clear audit trail for count data, enhancing scientific value.\n\n\n\nWhy eBirdCBC Matters\nCBCs are one of the longest-running community science projects, offering valuable insights into bird populations over time. By modernizing this tradition with eBirdCBC, we can: - Foster greater interest and participation. - Ensure data accuracy and integrity. - Provide tools for better understanding environmental changes.\nThis project bridges the gap between tradition and innovation, making CBCs more accessible and impactful for generations to come.\n© 2015-2024 Durrell D.

Side - Red team). We often meet on the W. Shore (middle area–log those birds in the N-side polygon area). We need to keep separate track of birds in these two areas so we can combine the two lists (and compare replicate lists) to sum the total number of birds on the lagoon.\nFor birds that are not moving, we can assign them to a specific polygon and add (SUM) separate polygons together.\nFor birds noted on lists from different parties that cover the same route (e.g. Red) that overlap with other Red team lists, we will utilize the high count (MAX) from the relevant overlapping lists.\nFor birds that are moving around (some large water birds/ducks/shorebirds), we will utilize the high count (MAX) from different lists potentially on the same or different subareas.\nMake sure to put whether the birds are moving around or are stationary in the comments for the species.\nRecall, birds from different lists are SUMmed!\n\n\n\nAccess trip reports for previous eBird CBC counts at Abbotts Lagoon\n\nPoint Reyes CBC Abbotts Lagoon Area #23 2023-12-16 Trip Report (16 Dec 2023)\n\n\nPoint Reyes CBC Abbotts Lagoon Area #23 2022-12-17 Trip Report (17 Dec 2022)\n\n\nPoint Reyes CBC Abbotts Lagoon Area #23 2021-12-18 Trip Report (18 Dec 2021)\n\n\nPoint Reyes CBC Abbotts Lagoon Area #23 2019-12-14 Trip Report (14 Dec 2019)\n\n\nPoint Reyes CBC Abbotts Lagoon Area #23 2018-12-15 Trip Report (15 Dec 2018)\n\n\nPoint Reyes CBC Abbotts Lagoon Area #23 2017-12-16 Trip Report (16 Dec 2017)\n\n\nPoint Reyes CBC Abbotts Lagoon Area #23 2016-12-17 Trip Report (17 Dec 2016)\n\n\nPoint Reyes CBC Abbotts Lagoon Area #23 2015-12-19 Trip Report (19 Dec 2015)\n(note the trip-lists are raw input for eBirdCBC so they haven’t been subject to the “Max-Sum”™ algorithm)!\n\n\n\nUnder construction: live example with final tally\n© 2015-2024 Durrell D.
