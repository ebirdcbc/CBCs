To encourage greater participation, it’s beneficial to bridge the traditional, primarily analog methods of the CBC with modern, digitally enabled practices like eBirding. This integration can make the CBC more accessible and engaging, attracting a broader audience and enhancing data collection.\nFor more information on the CBC and to find a count near you, visit the Audubon Christmas Bird Count page.
