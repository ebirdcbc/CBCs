    "text": "About eBirdCBC\neBirdCBC is a project designed to modernize and streamline the process of compiling data for Christmas Bird Counts (CBCs). Leveraging eBird’s data collection and tracking capabilities, eBirdCBC integrates these tools with an innovative algorithm to simplify workflows, eliminate double-counting, and enhance the reproducibility of CBCs.\n\nGoals\n\nEncourage Participation: Increase engagement by providing easier and more accessible data collection tools for bird counters.\nImprove Accuracy: Address challenges such as overlapping count areas and inconsistent methods with a robust data integration system.\nPreserve Knowledge: Ensure long-term reproducibility and documentation of count methods and results.\n\n\n\nMethods\n\nPreparation\n\nCreate an eBird persona for the CBC area to collect and centralize data.\nAssign participants to use either eBird or paper-based methods, allowing flexibility.\nCreate and share a trip report linked to the CBC, ensuring all participants’ checklists are included.\n\n\n\nData Integration\n\nCopy the trip report URL and paste it into the eBirdCBC tool.\nLog in using the shared eBird persona credentials.\nThe tool automatically gathers tracks and species data from all associated eBird checklists.\n\n\n\nCompilation\n\nUse Species Mode in the eBirdCBC tool to review counts species-by-species.\nIdentify overlapping counts visually using tracks and assign group numbers.\nApply the MAX-SUM™ algorithm:\n\nTake the maximum count for overlapping stationary birds.\nSum non-overlapping counts.\n\nExclude erroneous or unwanted data using the “Delete Group” feature.\n\n\n\nExport\n\nGenerate a comprehensive CSV report with species counts and grouped checklists.\nShare the database with compilers and upload it back into the app for review.\n\n\n\n\nKey Benefits\n\nEfficiency: Simplifies data compilation for CBC organizers.\nEngagement: Attracts younger participants by integrating with familiar digital tools.\nReproducibility: Creates a clear audit trail for count data, enhancing scientific value.\n\n\n\nWhy eBirdCBC Matters\nCBCs are one of the longest-running community science projects, offering valuable insights into bird populations over time. By modernizing this tradition with eBirdCBC, we can: - Foster greater interest and participation. - Ensure data accuracy and integrity. - Provide tools for better understanding environmental changes.\nThis project bridges the gap between tradition and innovation, making CBCs more accessible and impactful for generations to come."
