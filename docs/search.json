    "text": "Using the eBirdCBC program\n\neBirdCBC Overview\neBirdCBC is an Electron app designed to use eBird best practices for generating accurate CBC counts for a given area. It displays a map of checklists and allows users to group them, employing the MAX-SUM algorithm, thereby avoiding double-counting the same birds.\n\n\nGetting started\nThese are paraphrased from the instructions on the eBirdCBC development site here.\nInstallation\n• Download: Visit the releases page to download the app for your operating system. We are using a precompiled disk image for ARM macs. For other platforms you need to access the source-code which must be compiled to work on your non-ARM machine. Due to the diversity of computer platforms, we don’t support trouble-shooting this process, but if you are computer savvy you shouldn’t have too much trouble. If you do find a bug or major issue you can submit a issue via GitHub.\n• Trust the App: Since the app isn’t signed, you’ll need to grant permission to run it.\n• Browser Requirement: Ensure Chrome or Chromium is installed.\n\n\nStep-by-step use\n\nInput Data:\n\n\nCopy the trip report URL and paste it into the eBirdCBC tool.\n\n-or-\n\nEnter checklist IDs separated by commas or input a trip report.\nClick Submit to add them to the database.\nLog into eBird using the shared eBird persona credentials via the prompted Chrome window to allow the app to retrieve tracks. The window will close automatically when finished.\nThe tool automatically gathers tracks and species data from all associated eBird checklists.\n\n\nView and Group Checklists:\n\n\nChecklists and tracks appear on the map.\nClick on points to view details.\nGroup checklists covering the same areas to avoid double-counting. High counts from grouped checklists are automatically taken.\n\n\nSpecies View for Precision:\n\n\nUse Species View to group specific species across checklists (e.g., ensure one Long-tailed Duck seen on three lists is counted only once).\nThe total count for grouped species is displayed in the dropdown menu.\n\n\nExport and Manage Data:\n\n\nClick Get Species to export a CSV of species and counts.\nDO NOT Click Clear to reset the database (this action cannot be undone) unless you want to start over.\nShare data with the csv, user a spreadsheet to connect it to your compiler’s submission spreadsheet.\nShare the database by copying the database.db file from the ~/Documents/eBirdCBC/ folder to another computer.\n\n\nFinal Compilation\n\nIf you find errors in the lists or need detailed memos for the trip or species, ask your eBirders to fix those lists and reshare them with your eBird area persona.\nThen use Species Mode in the eBirdCBC tool to review counts species-by-species.\nIdentify overlapping counts visually using tracks and assign group numbers.\nThe MAX-SUM algorithm:\n\nWill automatically take the maximum count for overlapping stationary birds.\nAnd Sum non-overlapping counts.\n\nExclude erroneous or unwanted data using the “Delete Group” feature.\nSave (frequently) the final results.\n\n\n\nTips for Export\n\nGenerate a comprehensive CSV report with species counts and grouped checklists.\nWe generally use a spreadsheet to link eBirdCBC csv output to the compilers spreadsheet input.\nThen we share that data with compilers.\nUsing archived databases you can upload the data back into the app for future review.\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\nInteractivity with a map-view of every eBird checklist\nExport CSV data export\nShare or Archive the database for future reference\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting & tips and tricks\n\nDO NOT Click Clear to reset the database (this action cannot be undone) unless you want to start over.\nLook at the most up-to-date instructions here.\nIf you find a programming error, please log the issue via GitHub.\nContact us if you have any questions or suggestions, or you would like to improve the code-base by joining the GitHub project.\n© 2015-2024 Durrell D.

    "text": "Abbotts Lagoon: Teams for Unique ‘Birdsheds’\nPart of the Point Reyes Christmas Bird Count, Abbotts Lagoon has long held the distinction of the most species seen due to its varied habitats ranging from the forest, coastal scrub, riparian woodlands, open rangelands, coastal prarie dunes and of course the both upper and lower Abbotts lagoon, the outer beach and the ocean. Since 2015 we have divided Abbotts Lagoon subarea #23 into different routes with the approximate extent that birds can be seen from anywhere on that route defining a ‘birdshed’ or color-coded polygon. We use the colors to refer to the routes, polygons and the team that covers them.\n\nColor-coded routes and polygons:\nBelow you can see the Abbotts Lagoon CBC area 23 divided into multiple non-overlapping color-coded polygons with a track that each team follows to count birds (Blue, Red (2-shades), Yellow, Orange). The main lagoon itself is divided into N and S regions as well as the standard seawatch from the N. berm and various dune and beach wanderings.\n\n\n\nAbbotts Lagoon CBC area number 23 count territories including Blue, Red, Yellow, and Orange Summary of tracks and polygons from 2019 and 2021 (QGIS map by M.

Kapan).\n\n\nDirections for Abbotts Lagoon subarea #23:\nTeams first complete the following assigned routes through unique polygons and then take replicate eBird data when moving across other teams’ assigned territories/polygons; this allows us to compare different lists for the same area and take the high counts for stationary birds.\n\nThe Abbotts Lagoon CBC area number 23 map is divided into multiple non-overlapping color-coded polygons with a track that each team follows to count birds (Blue, Red, Yellow, Orange, etc.).\nAbbotts Lagoon is divided into two polygons (the N side - Blue Team, S. Side - Red team). We often meet on the W. Shore (middle area–log those birds in the N-side polygon area). We need to keep separate track of birds in these two areas so we can combine the two lists (and compare replicate lists) to sum the total number of birds on the lagoon.\nFor birds that are not moving, we can assign them to a specific polygon and add (SUM) separate polygons together.\nFor birds noted on lists from different parties that cover the same route (e.g. Red) that overlap with other Red team lists, we will utilize the high count (MAX) from the relevant overlapping lists.\nFor birds that are moving around (some large water birds/ducks/shorebirds), we will utilize the high count (MAX) from different lists potentially on the same or different subareas.\nMake sure to put whether the birds are moving around or are stationary in the comments for the species.\nRecall, birds from different lists are SUMmed!\n\n\n\nAccess trip reports for previous eBird CBC counts at Abbotts Lagoon\n\nPoint Reyes CBC Abbotts Lagoon Area #23 2023-12-16 Trip Report (16 Dec 2023)\n\n\nPoint Reyes CBC Abbotts Lagoon Area #23 2022-12-17 Trip Report (17 Dec 2022)\n\n\nPoint Reyes CBC Abbotts Lagoon Area #23 2021-12-18 Trip Report (18 Dec 2021)\n\n\nPoint Reyes CBC Abbotts Lagoon Area #23 2019-12-14 Trip Report (14 Dec 2019)\n\n\nPoint Reyes CBC Abbotts Lagoon Area #23 2018-12-15 Trip Report (15 Dec 2018)\n\n\nPoint Reyes CBC Abbotts Lagoon Area #23 2017-12-16 Trip Report (16 Dec 2017)\n\n\nPoint Reyes CBC Abbotts Lagoon Area #23 2016-12-17 Trip Report (17 Dec 2016)\n\n\nPoint Reyes CBC Abbotts Lagoon Area #23 2015-12-19 Trip Report (19 Dec 2015)\n(note the trip-lists are raw input for eBirdCBC so they haven’t been subject to the “Max-Sum” algorithm)!\n\n\n\nUnder construction: live example with final tally\n© 2015-2024 Durrell D.

    "text": "Using the eBirdCBC method\neBirdCBC is a set of field methods (using eBird) and a web-based program (eBirdCBC) designed to modernize and streamline the process of compiling data for Christmas Bird Counts (CBCs). Leveraging eBirdmobile’s data collection and tracking capabilities, eBirdCBC integrates these tools with an innovative MAX-SUM algorithm to simplify workflows, eliminate double-counting, and enhance the reproducibility of CBCs. This page instructs area leaders on the details, but is useful for counters as well as compilers to understand how to use the eBirdCBC method before the count, in the field, and after the count.\n\nMAX-SUM algorithm\nThe MAX-SUM algorithm is a way to make sure we count birds accurately during a Christmas Bird Count, especially when multiple teams will traverse the same location and might see the same birds. Here’s how it works in simple terms:\n\nWhen teams cross the same area and Birds Stay Still: If two teams report the same stationary birds (like a sparrows from the same flock, or herons standing in the same pond), we take the highest number of that species reported by any team. To do this we apply the function MAX to the birds in overlapping lists. This avoids double-counting but still gives us the best estimate.\nWhen teams are in separate areas but the Species Moves Around: For birds that are flying or moving between areas (like swans or hawks), we still take the MAX for that species from the numbers reported by different teams if we can determine from the details in the observations (see field protocol) that they are the same birds.\nWhen teams are in separate areas and the Species are Not Moving Around: For birds that are stationary we combine lists from different areas using the SUM function for that species from the numbers reported by different teams. This is usually true for all small bird species that do not move between lists for different subareas. A few exceptions might be high flyover flocks of finch family birds or Cedar Waxwings.\n\nIn short: The eBirdCBC program takes the MAX for overlapping counts and SUM the counts for non-overlapping areas. This keeps the bird count as accurate as possible without overestimating or underestimating the numbers.\n\n\nCount area leaders: how to prepare for an eBird-Powered Count Area before going to the field\nBelow are the methods for area leaders including what to do before the count, how to plan your team assignments and instruct your team-members, and what to do after the count. All participants should read these over to understand what your area leader going to do with the data you collect using the participant team’s field protocol.\n\nPre-count preparation\n\nArea leaders need a new eBird account with a new eBird persona for the CBC area to collect and centralize data. This is a new eBird login from a new eBird email. For instance create a login e.g. “myebirdarea” with a new email address e.g. “myebirdarea@gmail.com.” This eBird persona ‘rides along’ with each group and serves to aggregate all the eBird data for the count.\nAssign area participants in small groups non-overlapping routes (see Field protocol) to use either eBird or paper-based methods that get transcribed to eBird after the count, allowing flexibility.\nEach team of one or more people birding independently use eBird to track their observations (see below and Field protocol).\n\n\nPlanning your area’s team assignments\n\nDivide the count subareas into non-overlapping routes. These may correspond roughly to the concept of the ‘birdshed’ and form an area where you can likely keep track of raptors and large-birds. If you assign a large area to a team, this might be a set of connected ‘birdsheds’ that you’ll divide into smaller areas for lists by each habitat.\nMap these routes and define clear boundaries for forming ‘birdsheds’ distinct polygons.\nColor-code the routes or polygons to reduce confusion.\nIndicate on the map where to start and stop each eBird list (see Field protocol for more information).\nIf you have existing eBird track data, use eBirdCBC to plot out the individual list areas.\nBuild team assignments based on these color-coded polygons.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the count\n\nWork with the team to review and correct each list’s data and ensure the final list is shared back to the the central eBird persona.\nThis process can be a bit cumbersome: team leaders share the list to your eBird persona, you make corrections and share it back to the team leader who accept the list. If they make further corrections or add photographs, you need to have them reshare the list to your eBird persona to have the final data for compilation.\nCombine all the lists and create and share a trip report linked to the CBC, ensuring all participants’ checklists are included.\nPro-tip, use your new eBird persona email to organize all the communication with your participants!\nCaution: Use your eBird persona only on the day of the count or during count week. It is specifically for the CBC to aggregate all data from each group or participant’s separate eBird lists.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the eBird CBC program: quick start\n\nData Integration\n\nFor installation and detailed instructions see: Using the eBirdCBC program\nOpen eBirdCBC\nCopy the trip report URL and paste it into the eBirdCBC tool.\nLog into eBird using the shared eBird persona credentials.\nThe tool automatically gathers tracks and species data from all associated eBird checklists.\n\n\n\nCompilation\n\nUse Species Mode in the eBirdCBC tool to review counts species-by-species.\nIdentify overlapping counts visually using tracks and assign group numbers.\nApply the MAX-SUM algorithm:\n\nTake the maximum count for overlapping stationary birds.\nSum non-overlapping counts.\n\nExclude erroneous or unwanted data using the “Delete Group” feature.\nSave (frequently) the final results.\n\n\n\nExport\n\nGenerate a comprehensive CSV report with species counts and grouped checklists.\nWe generally use a spreadsheet to link eBirdCBC csv output to the compilers spreadsheet input.\nThen we share that data with compilers.\nWe an upload the data back into the app for review.\n\n© 2015-2024 Durrell D.

    "text": "Protocol for eBirding a CBC!\neBirdCBC uses eBird and eBird tracks to record all bird and participant data, automating the summary of territory counts for the Christmas Bird Count (CBC). This is combined with eBird mobile and manual data collection throughout the day, including capturing effort details and sightings of raptors and large birds.\n\nBefore the count\n\nFamiliarize yourself with this protocol.\nGet your team assignment from your area leader.\nPractice by birding in your assigned area during count-week the 3 days before or after your CBC if you can.\nEnsure you have eBird Mobile working, Bring a spare battery for your phone, print out data forms provided by your area leader, prepare for a long-day birding.\n\n\n\nField protocol: eBird lists & tracks\nFor a given team, designate a team member to use eBird mobile to track team location and log birds using one of the following methods:\n\nActivate eBird starting a new list enabling eBird tracks.\n\nTally birds at the same time on the app.\n\n-or put your phone in your pocket and-\n\nWrite the date, time, location & each bird encountered on paper and transfer to eBird mobile ASAP. See this convenient PDF form for the latter.\n\nEither way, eBird Mobile tracks allow us to divide observations by route for us to automatically compile in eBird.\n\n\n\nKeeping track of the effort and bird details by hand\nDesignate a second member as a ‘back-up’ to log participants, effort, raptors & large flyover birds, and rare bird notes on paper to later transcribe the following into the eBird memo:\n\nTeam name and list number (i.e. Haypress #1).\nThe name (initials) of each participant. \nExact start and stop times & locations for each list (sometimes eBird tracks fail).\nNote the weather: cloud cover, temperature, wind (Beaufort scale) & precipitation (none, trace, light, medium, heavy).\n\n\n\n\nExample of effort memo for a given list. Note everything needed to figure out the who, the where, the when, the weather, the raptors and large birds as well as the route. In this case the user employed 4-letter bird codes to indicate the raptors: AMKE = American Kestrel, NOHA = Northern Harrier.\n\n\n\n\n\nNorthern Harrier flying past at Tennessee Valley CBC, © D.

Also you can print up downloadable rare bird forms.\nPhotographs: Photos and/or audio recordings of diagnostic vocalizations are the best evidence of a rare bird. Photos are preferably of good quality showing diagnostic features.\n\n\n\nAfter the count:\n\nUpload and Share: Last but not least–after your eBird lists are all set and uploaded to eBird, share them with your area leader’s ‘area persona’ (the eBird username that the area leader uses to aggregate all the day’s lists) using the share function either from eBird mobile, or from the your eBird list on the web interface. If they ask you to correct something, do so and RESHARE back to their eBird persona.\n\n\n\nReminders: Do’s, Hints, Tips & tricks, Don’ts\n\nEach team covers their assigned route/polygon starting at sunrise early in the day. If you then traverse another team’s area, or a part of it, start a new list following their area/list assignments.\nCreate a new eBird list for each location your area leader suggests, such as for each unique habitat within your ‘birdshed’ or count area along your route or polygon, with eBird tracks enabled. This serves as the foundation for both bird observations and CBC effort data (see below for hints on manual data collection).\nFor large areas or polygons, don’t be afraid to create multiple lists, especially when transitioning between habitats or exiting a ‘birdshed’ where larger birds can no longer be tracked.\nTranscribe eBird data and manual effort notes into eBird list comments. Put raptor details into the species comments.\nWhen crossing into other teams’ polygons, create separate eBird lists to collect replicate eBird data. These data will be compared and we will use the high counts (e.g. =MAX) for overlapping stationary birds.\nRecord birds seen between polygons in the species comments with relevant details.\nWhen retracing your steps, don’t just count ‘new’ birds, make a complete list and let the MAX-SUM algorithm do the work of figuring out new birds and high-counts.\nDo not include birds seen by people outside your CBC party unless you see them too!\n\n© 2015-2024 Durrell D.
