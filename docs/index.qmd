## eBirdCBC Project

Welcome to the eBirdCBC project, a hybrid approach to modernizing the Christmas Bird Count (CBC) using eBird data and tools. Explore how we blend traditional methods with digital tools to enhance accuracy, repeatability, increase CBC participation, and the long-term value for bird conservation efforts.
