Photos are preferably of good quality showing diagnostic features.\n\n### Reminders\n\n-   Each team covers their assigned route/polygon starting at sunrise early in the day.\n\n-   Create a new eBird list for each unique count area (polygon) with eBird tracks enabled. This *forms* the basis for both bird observations and CBC effort data (see below for hints on manual data collection).\n\n-   For large polygons, create multiple lists, especially when moving from one habitat to another or when you have passed out of an area (a 'birdshed') where you cannot track the larger birds you just counted any more.\n\n-   Transcribe eBird data and manual effort notes into eBird list comments. Put raptor details into the species comments.\n\n-   When crossing into other teams’ polygons, create separate eBird lists to collect replicate eBird data. These data will be compared and we will use the *high counts* (e.g. =MAX) for overlapping stationary birds.\n\n-   Record birds seen between polygons in the species comments with relevant details.\n\n-   Do not include birds seen by people outside your CBC party.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Protocol for eBirding a CBC!\n\neBirdCBC uses eBird and eBird tracks to record all bird and participant data, automating the summary of territory counts for the Christmas Bird Count (CBC).
